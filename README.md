## Project Overview

This repository contains models and simulations for studying the effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and chemotherapy on tumor cells for the ERC-funded project "sublethal". The project includes both deterministic and stochastic models implemented in Python.

## Models

### Intracellular Damage Model

Simulates the damage and repair of intracellular components, focusing on calcium ions and foci formation.

### Simplified Chemo-Immunotherapy Model

Simulates the interaction between tumor cells, CTLs, and chemotherapy, considering various rates of cell death, repair, and proliferation.

### Stochastic Models

Implements stochastic simulations using the Gillespie algorithm to model CTL-mediated tumor cell damage and the effects of chemotherapy.
